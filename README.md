- **Task Automation:** Automate routine tasks to improve efficiency.
- **Query Resolution:** Address user queries and provide accurate responses.

## Prerequisites
To set up and deploy AzureChat, you will need the following prerequisites:
- An Azure account with access to Azure services.
- Basic knowledge of Python and Flask for backend development.
- Familiarity with Azure Cognitive Services for implementing NLU capabilities.
